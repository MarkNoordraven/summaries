[Interview with Andriy Velykyy and Yuri Savchenko of Allbridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_kSvs8TJPM&t=2439s)
Goals for end of summer (yuri disagrees)
- all major chains connects
- all security audits passed
- most of the code open sourced
- decentralization for validators
- better, easier ui
- no need to do 2 transactions
- receive destination tokens on other chain

after that:
- working on sdk so that other developers can integrate allbridge
- cross-chain swap: take ether on ether, and buy sol on solana with the bridge
- cross-chain lending: take ether, lock it on ether, buy sol but keep eth as collateral

- andriyy wants to do less features, but to them better.
- He thinks this roadmap will cover the year
- andriyy doesn't want to become the scrappy competitor, he aims higher

- yuri not sure if they can compete with multichain in evm space
