### [MetaPortal podcast](https://metaportal.substack.com/p/metaportal-podcast-special-kieran)

- 100,000 plots of land
- Land is a city builder game
- 26 types of buildings that one can build
- buildings have scifi names
- you're building up your land plot to mine resources, process them using the factories you've build, and sell the resources to main game
- in game transactions like travel fees, shard curing, skins require different resources
- x% (~10% but can change) or resources for in-game transactions come from land owners
- land owners can sell their resources asap, or hold them and pool them, which increase the price of the in-game functions, or flood the market
- game theory can start binding together and pool resources like OPEC
- yield guild already mentions they are gonna spend 2.5 million dollars on land
- target of 100 million players!
- yield guild will hire people to become digital farmers on their land
- minigame is silod from the rest of the core team by bringing on new resources
- minigame is called illuvium zero
- volgende 6 tot 8 weken komt het land verkoop uit
- illuvium zero will also be a mobile game
- he will give people the choice to grind themselves an illuvial collection, but can't rule out offering scholarships

### [Kyle Wilson Youtube interview with Aaron Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz_fc87qm1k)

- all illuvials in the first set are themed after endangered of extinct animals. This is because this contains something familiar, but also something unfamiliar. This is why you won't see illuvials with 4 heads or alien designs. 
- Aaron would have gone with programmatic variations on the looks of illuvials, not hand-crafted iconic pieces.
- Atlas are inspired on axilotls
- There's a polar bear inspired Illuvial because polar bears are endangered
- The archi-archeleum is a noble, mistical line that is more like a support character
- Atlas was a mistake. There were 2 groups of people creating concept art, and the wrong one got sent to the artist, but when it got back from the artists, it was a lucky accident as the outcome was cute as hell
- Ramphyre was named after the ptaerodactyl Ramphiranicus, and it's a fire character that flies up and rams into things, therefore the name.
- The balancer sale Illuvials are final, because the NFT is immutable.
- There's a really cute Illuvial that hasn't been announced yet
- every game that will ever be played, will be stored in their servers. This is possible because if the positions and illuvials are known, the battle and the outcome is fully deterministic and can be exported to a tiny text file.
- the randomness to seed the game comes from the coordinates of the places illuvials (since they can be placed anywhere, there will be tiny differences in fractions of centimeters of placement which is sufficient
- the autobattler is furthest along, because it ha
- autobattler is fully data-driven and fully deterministic, as long as the characters have been put in place, the match will be the same.
- you will be able to record the match, then render it out afterwards for amazing graphics quality, and also a camera that you can play around with
- for the closed beta, first a small amount of people will purely go into the autobattler part of the game. after that, a large amount of people into the autobattler, 
- the closed beta will start of being a pve experience (survival mode, wave after wave of illuvials), then overworld part will be released and everything will be reset
- gameplay loop: run around, collect stuff, fight in autobattler
- difference between private and public beta: everyone will be able to access the public beta, and whatever you mint you keep
- there won't be an advantage from illuvium zero private beta, it will be server wiped too
- storyline: giant spaceship crashes, 2 separate games; race of people who have to figure out, and recoinnaissance drones that get dispersed over the whole world
- both games go live the same day
- most of the coding for illuvium zero is already done
- they are planning for illuvium zero to become a lot bigger later on
- the long term plan for illuvium zero is to make it like total annihilation, aaron's favorite game
- every illuvials will have some random stats, so little random modifications to the stats. These are randomly generated and the hash value used for that, will deliver randomness to every other game your illuvials will move to. 
- It doesn't guarantee that if your random stats are good in this game, they will be good in all future games, but it will make it more likely, giving long-term value to good statted illuvials!
- they have a hash table that generates the randomness for your character in all future titles.
- the holographic illuvials will look different on the map than than the effect on the NFT's, but still cool
- lowend hardware requirements: 1050 TI running 30 fps, but will be lowered progressively as they are working to make the game mobile friendly
- team is currently about 100 people
- 


### [Bankless Play to earn panel with Gaby and Kieran Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQ4GdmPNo8)
- Kieran thinks Play to Earn will easily be bigger than DeFi in the short term, and DeFi be bigger in 30-40 years
- They are aiming for 100 million players
- There will be little events and achievements where one can earn real money
- Kieran has turned bullish Axie now that they raised 124 million dollars to expand their team
- Kieran is speaking to people from AAA gaming who will start developing blockchain games, but it could take years as games take years to build.
- Kieran started investing more into Play to Earn as he gets pitches and is asked to be a seed investor.
- Guild of Guardians, Ember Swords and Star Atlas, Flappy Birds, Scifer are games that seem interesting to the panel

### [Illuvium trailer launch discord chat where Aaron joined]
- The three cofounders together hold a bit under 1.4 million ILV. They each hold the same amount, and because they're insanely competitive, neither will sell their tokens anytime soon because they would have less than the others


### [Illuvium: Von Neumann Interview - The Lead Artist of Illuvium (Grant Warwick)!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpL6bqCCfU)
- artist since 15
- had an accident, had to wear an eye patch for months
- got a pc with burned dvds imported from japan with all kinds of software
- got a connection to a studio from Johhn singleton, a billionaire
- worked at a studio at 17 years old
- he left film industry and wanted to push photorealism in the print industry
- he was fully self-taught, didnt use tutorials online
- he made mastering CGI, and after he reached that pinnacle he got depressed
- kieran, grant and aaron are very complimentary in skills
- Grant is obsessed with mainstream art like marvel, he has marvel tattoos
- Grant doesn't like sidescrolling game
- Myst was a big in the Warwick family, they had a competition of who could finish Myst the first, and there were no guides back then
- he chose van Neumann because he was one of the smartest and most accomplished people ever
- he tried going fully anon within the studio with voice modulator, but it was just too hard to recruit top cgi talent
- norman bolau would be the other name he would have picked, inventor of gmo crops
- ILV is doing so many things differently (tokenomics, the way they do game development, the community they built-up before the game launches)
- they really want to make the next pokemon
- the reason they didnt do much gameplay in the trailer, is because they needed to pull people in first
- the writer on illuvium is called Cyrus, he writes it together with Aaron
- they make mistakes within the studio because theyre new, they sometimes decide to pull a month's work based on feedback
- if the game sucks, grant will put a screwdriver though aaron's head
- aaron is the least social, but he thinks differently and solves problems differently. Development team has a huge amount of respect for him. People are really trusting in knowing what he's doing.
- Other studios spend 4-7 years, they want to do it quickly, efficiently and fast, so they dont want to lose out on the motivation they've tapped into.
- underpaid top cgi artists, work 2 hours per day and the rest of the day on facebook
- they don't tell people to work long hours or weekends with very few exceptions. The people who got in early put in 10-12 hours per day because it is life changing for them, their output is godlike.
- they only have 2 juniors on the team, so it's like they are a 300 person team
- they were working on the trailer until the last minute
- they don't really make videos of the daily work, due to being so busy, but they have some video on balancer sale and this launch, they may make a documentary sometime
- the trailer had to go through 8 people's hands, if anything went wrong they were screwed
- they were at a retreat with friends for the trailer launch, and only had an ipad with them
- Grant is most passionate about biome and environment creation and environmental composition. He did some things that was implemented by others in the lion king movie
- people are sleeping on the environment.
- he hired people who love making plants
- the plants will all be animated and passive vfx
- some things wont be ready on release
- some plants are not interactive, but for immersion they want every plant to be interactive when you jump on it, shoot it, etc
- they are currently working heavily on 4 environments: sanctum mesa, crimson wastes, halcyon sea, brightland steppes (the one in the trailer)
- stage 1 penguin is named slappin(?), it's a penguin line of 3 stages
- they have over 30 characters nearing implementation
- they are blasting out hundreds of plant assets
- every texture is unique, they haven't bought a single one
- it's easier to start with something details
- they make every assets with 4-8k textures
- dimitry and grant know eachother from before, dmitry learned from grant and is now also bringing things to the new level
- the game looks a bit more polished is that they take full high ress cinematic workflow, and apply it to every asset.
- the biggest tasks grant has, is that if you play the game it looks like Illuvium
- Aaron doesn't let anything stand
- Aaron's desktop only has my computer, Grants desktop is full of icons
- the backend is super clean and smooth
- they need to build out the environment team to set dress the assets in the world, this is relatively quick work
- the weather or day/night doesn't change in real time, it will be randomly different though whenever you spawn into a region via the obelisk.
- they are going to start on release with 1 type of lighting scenario's for each of the biomes, and it's relatively quick process to add more lighting scenario's every time
- they want every biome to be completely unique
- abyssal basin is swamp bione
- they had an idea that in abyssal basin
- he wants to push brightland steppes into a jump puzzle region
- one of his biggest fears
- the autobattler is on lock, they still need to do a couple of things like chain attacks, mozart animations
- The autobattler already shits on teamfight tactics. 
- He is not an autobattler fan
- rocket league of the only game he played in the last 4-5 years
- the cinematic mode where you can pan the autobattler camera is inspired by rocket league
- if UE5 becomes stable and hard tested, he is more than happy to shift over. It won't look better, but will be a bit more optimised on the performance
- you don't need to have worked on AAA games to have expert UI/UX design. Florian has never worked on a game before, but he has learned himself how to implement UI in Unreal Engine
- Florian was working so hard on the trailer, he got arrested due to not renewing his visa
- he worked on the trailer with an ice bucket under the desk, due to tendonitis and working too hard
- he wants to get to a polished state for next march???
- he had people on the team early on who doubted that they would get 150 characters out, they are no longer on the team
- they are hiring 15 people every month
- they have been hesitant on adding easter eggs, because he wants the game to be about mechanics, not easter eggs
- Grant has woven in an easter egg that will be right under people's noses!
- Myst is his favorite game, so he will have something myst related in type of easter egg solving style
- if they had horizon forbidden west time and team size, they would make the overworld tomb raider and myst combined, and kept the autobattler the way it is
- the best thing they can do is start small and polish it, they refuse to make it a shitty bug fest
- he equates the play to earn to social media being invented
- each biome has its own unique battleboard. they have thoughts about skins for battle boards, but more realistically they will just add new biomes altogether
- the people who get the tier 5 land bases, will get their own battleboard
- grant will start modelling the leviathan arena in the cc-channel
- there will be a leviathan arena in every zone? it will be spooky and look like a UFC competitive arena. THe leviathan arena is the crashed hull of the ship in the trailer.
- they want to make it for tournaments, that the battleboard floats up for the final
- they will make variants for every zone, but they will not all be crashed spaceships
- each biome is a small segment within the larger biome. The edges of the zones will be sealed off by 
- when you start in the same in sanctum mesa, the obelisk isn't activated. The first person who activates it, will get an NFT of sanctum mesa, then it unlocks for everyone
- there will be overworld easter eggs, and things you have to do in the world
- it will be quite difficult to problem solve to find the first obelisk, it wont be discovered in the first 10 minutes
- for the next game, he wants the ability to see in the interface what he needs in his collection, and whenever another player catches the illuvial that you're looking for, it pops up a screen linking that user's profile and his collection. you will be able to disable it as a player if you dont want these popups
- there will be people making a game out of starting with 10 usd and trading up
- they want to have a leaderboard system that shows who has the number one character
- the swords will have different types, like watery sword, fiery sword
- they want everything to be polished and up to AAA standard
- expect that things will always keep improving
- he has calls with aaron that go for 3-4 hours
- his biggest fear on game launch is that people want more, that they havent added enough easter eggs
- Ben comes from RIOT and works with Aaron. He loves how fast his ideas get implemented
- every person they have hired come from a place where they are shackled to run free
- the studio kind of operates on a Monday-Friday schedule, but they work whenever they want. If they're not feeling it, theyre free to take time off. THey gotta hire the right people and trust that they will take time off when they need it.
- Kieran is just a troll when it comes to AXS, he does respect it
- They want to get to 300, 500, 1000 people working on the game. They want a movie, a netflix series and multiple games in development
- They got 130-140 people working
- if the members are not feeling it, they have the freedom to take the time off
- They could easily implement a pokemon Snap game
- you are on rails, just like pokemon Snap, you take photo's, and each photo is an NFT!!
- a game like pokemon snap doesn't have the longevity, but is siper easy to make
- Grant has always had 2 things on his bucket list: make a movie and make a game studio with his brothers
- Kieran is out there talking to investors all the time to see how far he can push it
- it took em 30 seconds to decide on locking the tokens
- they want to give revenue distributions to people who play the game well, like getting a high score, or something else
- kieran learned from mistakes 
- This game has so much going for it, the biggest revenue distribution will be a huge boon that Blizzard and EA will never do, the biggest esports tournament ever
- alex left ILM working on projects like Ready player One to move to thailand so he could go away from that mainstream culture
- people on the team have balls, they are already at the pinnacle of their careers
- there will be character customization at some point, but probably not on launch as it requires a little mini team
- alex created the character customization in All Points Bulletin
- they're about to go on a big big big hiring spree, high profile people
- a lot of artists want to work on something cool, doubling their salary isn't enough
- he hopes they've crossed the threshold to where people will go to them instead of ILV labs looking for people
- it's up to mainstream studios to keep up with them or buy it out
- one of their priorities is a solid backend that cant be botted or hacked
- there will be different boots, armor, shoulder pads, helmet, jet pack, mozart all as NFT's
- you can't push it too far with different armor pieces, otherwise it will like a clown suit
- the jet pack will also get bigger and more powerful
- how looking for and cap
- you see the illuvials in the overworld once you scan them. You have a visor which can pulse out an energy wave that picks up the signal of those singularities, you go hunt it down and shoot it, and it might be a ramphyre, but you don't know what it is until you shoot it. It warps like the rhino character in the trailer, the rhino character jumping into the singularity was arlend shooting it, it morphing from a character-like singularity into the character running, the tracking dart hits it and reveals it to be what the character is, it is then going to try and escape the overworld,it's going to jump into the warp (called singularity), and you've got a certain amount of time to follow it into the warp and chase it into the auto-battle. when you're in the autobattle, it will bring in more or less ally illuvials to fight you, depending on the level of the illuvial.
