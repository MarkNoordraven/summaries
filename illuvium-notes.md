### [MetaPortal podcast](https://metaportal.substack.com/p/metaportal-podcast-special-kieran)

- 100,000 plots of land
- Land is a city builder game
- 26 types of buildings that one can build
- buildings have scifi names
- you're building up your land plot to mine resources, process them using the factories you've build, and sell the resources to main game
- in game transactions like travel fees, shard curing, skins require different resources
- x% (~10% but can change) or resources for in-game transactions come from land owners
- land owners can sell their resources asap, or hold them and pool them, which increase the price of the in-game functions, or flood the market
- game theory can start binding together and pool resources like OPEC
- yield guild already mentions they are gonna spend 2.5 million dollars on land
- target of 100 million players!
- yield guild will hire people to become digital farmers on their land
- minigame is silod from the rest of the core team by bringing on new resources
- minigame is called illuvium zero
- volgende 6 tot 8 weken komt het land verkoop uit
- illuvium zero will also be a mobile game
- he will give people the choice to grind themselves an illuvial collection, but can't rule out offering scholarships

### [Kyle Wilson Youtube interview with Aaron Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz_fc87qm1k)

- all illuvials in the first set are themed after endangered of extinct animals. This is because this contains something familiar, but also something unfamiliar. This is why you won't see illuvials with 4 heads or alien designs. 
- Aaron would have gone with programmatic variations on the looks of illuvials, not hand-crafted iconic pieces.
- Atlas are inspired on axilotls
- There's a polar bear inspired Illuvial because polar bears are endangered
- The archi-archeleum is a noble, mistical line that is more like a support character
- Atlas was a mistake. There were 2 groups of people creating concept art, and the wrong one got sent to the artist, but when it got back from the artists, it was a lucky accident as the outcome was cute as hell
- Ramphyre was named after the ptaerodactyl Ramphiranicus, and it's a fire character that flies up and rams into things, therefore the name.
- The balancer sale Illuvials are final, because the NFT is immutable.
- There's a really cute Illuvial that hasn't been announced yet
- every game that will ever be played, will be stored in their servers. This is possible because if the positions and illuvials are known, the battle and the outcome is fully deterministic and can be exported to a tiny text file.
- the randomness to seed the game comes from the coordinates of the places illuvials (since they can be placed anywhere, there will be tiny differences in fractions of centimeters of placement which is sufficient
- the autobattler is furthest along, because it ha
- autobattler is fully data-driven and fully deterministic, as long as the characters have been put in place, the match will be the same.
- you will be able to record the match, then render it out afterwards for amazing graphics quality, and also a camera that you can play around with
- for the closed beta, first a small amount of people will purely go into the autobattler part of the game. after that, a large amount of people into the autobattler, 
- the closed beta will start of being a pve experience (survival mode, wave after wave of illuvials), then overworld part will be released and everything will be reset
- gameplay loop: run around, collect stuff, fight in autobattler
- difference between private and public beta: everyone will be able to access the public beta, and whatever you mint you keep
- there won't be an advantage from illuvium zero private beta, it will be server wiped too
- storyline: giant spaceship crashes, 2 separate games; race of people who have to figure out, and recoinnaissance drones that get dispersed over the whole world
- both games go live the same day
- most of the coding for illuvium zero is already done
- they are planning for illuvium zero to become a lot bigger later on
- the long term plan for illuvium zero is to make it like total annihilation, aaron's favorite game
- every illuvials will have some random stats, so little random modifications to the stats. These are randomly generated and the hash value used for that, will deliver randomness to every other game your illuvials will move to. 
- It doesn't guarantee that if your random stats are good in this game, they will be good in all future games, but it will make it more likely, giving long-term value to good statted illuvials!
- they have a hash table that generates the randomness for your character in all future titles.
- the holographic illuvials will look different on the map than than the effect on the NFT's, but still cool
- lowend hardware requirements: 1050 TI running 30 fps, but will be lowered progressively as they are working to make the game mobile friendly
- team is currently about 100 people

### [Bankless Play to earn panel with Gaby and Kieran Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQ4GdmPNo8)
- Kieran thinks Play to Earn will easily be bigger than DeFi in the short term, and DeFi be bigger in 30-40 years
- They are aiming for 100 million players
- There will be little events and achievements where one can earn real money
- Kieran has turned bullish Axie now that they raised 124 million dollars to expand their team
- Kieran is speaking to people from AAA gaming who will start developing blockchain games, but it could take years as games take years to build.
- Kieran started investing more into Play to Earn as he gets pitches and is asked to be a seed investor.
- Guild of Guardians, Ember Swords and Star Atlas, Flappy Birds, Scifer are games that seem interesting to the panel

### [Illuvium trailer launch discord chat where Aaron joined]
- The three cofounders together hold a bit under 1.4 million ILV. They each hold the same amount, and because they're insanely competitive, neither will sell their tokens anytime soon because they would have less than the others


### [Illuvium: Von Neumann Interview - The Lead Artist of Illuvium (Grant Warwick)!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpL6bqCCfU)
- artist since 15
- had an accident, had to wear an eye patch for months
- got a pc with burned dvds imported from japan with all kinds of software
- got a connection to a studio from Johhn singleton, a billionaire
- worked at a studio at 17 years old
- he left film industry and wanted to push photorealism in the print industry
- he was fully self-taught, didnt use tutorials online
- he made mastering CGI, and after he reached that pinnacle he got depressed
- kieran, grant and aaron are very complimentary in skills
- Grant is obsessed with mainstream art like marvel, he has marvel tattoos
- Grant doesn't like sidescrolling game
- Myst was a big in the Warwick family, they had a competition of who could finish Myst the first, and there were no guides back then
- he chose van Neumann because he was one of the smartest and most accomplished people ever
- he tried going fully anon within the studio with voice modulator, but it was just too hard to recruit top cgi talent
- norman bolau would be the other name he would have picked, inventor of gmo crops
- ILV is doing so many things differently (tokenomics, the way they do game development, the community they built-up before the game launches)
- they really want to make the next pokemon
- the reason they didnt do much gameplay in the trailer, is because they needed to pull people in first
- the writer on illuvium is called Cyrus, he writes it together with Aaron
- they make mistakes within the studio because theyre new, they sometimes decide to pull a month's work based on feedback
- if the game sucks, grant will put a screwdriver though aaron's head
- aaron is the least social, but he thinks differently and solves problems differently. Development team has a huge amount of respect for him. People are really trusting in knowing what he's doing.
- Other studios spend 4-7 years, they want to do it quickly, efficiently and fast, so they dont want to lose out on the motivation they've tapped into.
- underpaid top cgi artists, work 2 hours per day and the rest of the day on facebook
- they don't tell people to work long hours or weekends with very few exceptions. The people who got in early put in 10-12 hours per day because it is life changing for them, their output is godlike.
- they only have 2 juniors on the team, so it's like they are a 300 person team
-
