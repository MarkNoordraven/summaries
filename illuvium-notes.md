- 100,000 plots of land
- Land is a city builder game
- 26 types of buildings that one can build
- buildings have scifi names
- you're building up your land plot to mine resources, process them using the factories you've build, and sell the resources to main game
- in game transactions like travel fees, shard curing, skins require different resources
- x% (~10% but can change) or resources for in-game transactions come from land owners
- land owners can sell their resources asap, or hold them and pool them, which increase the price of the in-game functions, or flood the market
- game theory can start binding together and pool resources like OPEC
- yield guild already mentions they are gonna spend 2.5 million dollars on land
- target of 100 million players!
- yield guild will hire people to become digital farmers on their land
- minigame is silod from the rest of the core team by bringing on new resources
- minigame is called illuvium zero
- volgende 6 tot 8 weken komt het land verkoop uit
- illuvium zero will also be a mobile game
- he will give people the choice to grind themselves an illuvial collection, but can't rule out offering scholarships

### [Kyle Wilson Youtube interview with Aaron Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz_fc87qm1k)

- all illuvials in the first set are themed after endangered of extinct animals. This is because this contains something familiar, but also something unfamiliar. This is why you won't see illuvials with 4 heads or alien designs. 
- Aaron would have gone with programmatic variations on the looks of illuvials, not hand-crafted iconic pieces.
- Atlas are inspired on axilotls
- There's a polar bear inspired Illuvial because polar bears are endangered
- The archi-archeleum is a noble, mistical line that is more like a support character
- Atlas was a mistake. There were 2 groups of people creating concept art, and the wrong one got sent to the artist, but when it got back from the artists, it was a lucky accident as the outcome was cute as hell
- Ramphyre was named after the ptaerodactyl Ramphiranicus, and it's a fire character that flies up and rams into things, therefore the name.
- The balancer sale Illuvials are final, because the NFT is immutable.
- There's a really cute Illuvial that hasn't been announced yet
- every game that will ever be played, will be stored in their servers. This is possible because if the positions and illuvials are known, the battle and the outcome is fully deterministic and can be exported to a tiny text file.
