### [MetaPortal podcast](https://metaportal.substack.com/p/metaportal-podcast-special-kieran)

- 100,000 plots of land
- Land is a city builder game
- 26 types of buildings that one can build
- buildings have scifi names
- you're building up your land plot to mine resources, process them using the factories you've build, and sell the resources to main game
- in game transactions like travel fees, shard curing, skins require different resources
- x% (~10% but can change) or resources for in-game transactions come from land owners
- land owners can sell their resources asap, or hold them and pool them, which increase the price of the in-game functions, or flood the market
- game theory can start binding together and pool resources like OPEC
- yield guild already mentions they are gonna spend 2.5 million dollars on land
- target of 100 million players!
- yield guild will hire people to become digital farmers on their land
- minigame is silod from the rest of the core team by bringing on new resources
- minigame is called illuvium zero
- volgende 6 tot 8 weken komt het land verkoop uit
- illuvium zero will also be a mobile game
- he will give people the choice to grind themselves an illuvial collection, but can't rule out offering scholarships

### [Kyle Wilson Youtube interview with Aaron Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz_fc87qm1k)

- all illuvials in the first set are themed after endangered of extinct animals. This is because this contains something familiar, but also something unfamiliar. This is why you won't see illuvials with 4 heads or alien designs. 
- Aaron would have gone with programmatic variations on the looks of illuvials, not hand-crafted iconic pieces.
- Atlas are inspired on axilotls
- There's a polar bear inspired Illuvial because polar bears are endangered
- The archi-archeleum is a noble, mistical line that is more like a support character
- Atlas was a mistake. There were 2 groups of people creating concept art, and the wrong one got sent to the artist, but when it got back from the artists, it was a lucky accident as the outcome was cute as hell
- Ramphyre was named after the ptaerodactyl Ramphiranicus, and it's a fire character that flies up and rams into things, therefore the name.
- The balancer sale Illuvials are final, because the NFT is immutable.
- There's a really cute Illuvial that hasn't been announced yet
- every game that will ever be played, will be stored in their servers. This is possible because if the positions and illuvials are known, the battle and the outcome is fully deterministic and can be exported to a tiny text file.
- the randomness to seed the game comes from the coordinates of the places illuvials (since they can be placed anywhere, there will be tiny differences in fractions of centimeters of placement which is sufficient
- the autobattler is furthest along, because it ha
- autobattler is fully data-driven and fully deterministic, as long as the characters have been put in place, the match will be the same.
- you will be able to record the match, then render it out afterwards for amazing graphics quality, and also a camera that you can play around with
- for the closed beta, first a small amount of people will purely go into the autobattler part of the game. after that, a large amount of people into the autobattler, 
- the closed beta will start of being a pve experience (survival mode, wave after wave of illuvials), then overworld part will be released and everything will be reset
- gameplay loop: run around, collect stuff, fight in autobattler
- difference between private and public beta: everyone will be able to access the public beta, and whatever you mint you keep
- there won't be an advantage from illuvium zero private beta, it will be server wiped too
- storyline: giant spaceship crashes, 2 separate games; race of people who have to figure out, and recoinnaissance drones that get dispersed over the whole world
- both games go live the same day
- most of the coding for illuvium zero is already done
- they are planning for illuvium zero to become a lot bigger later on
- the long term plan for illuvium zero is to make it like total annihilation, aaron's favorite game
- every illuvials will have some random stats, so little random modifications to the stats. These are randomly generated and the hash value used for that, will deliver randomness to every other game your illuvials will move to. 
- It doesn't guarantee that if your random stats are good in this game, they will be good in all future games, but it will make it more likely, giving long-term value to good statted illuvials!
- they have a hash table that generates the randomness for your character in all future titles.
- the holographic illuvials will look different on the map than than the effect on the NFT's, but still cool
- lowend hardware requirements: 1050 TI running 30 fps, but will be lowered progressively as they are working to make the game mobile friendly
- team is currently about 100 people
- 


### [Bankless Play to earn panel with Gaby and Kieran Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQ4GdmPNo8)
- Kieran thinks Play to Earn will easily be bigger than DeFi in the short term, and DeFi be bigger in 30-40 years
- They are aiming for 100 million players
- There will be little events and achievements where one can earn real money
- Kieran has turned bullish Axie now that they raised 124 million dollars to expand their team
- Kieran is speaking to people from AAA gaming who will start developing blockchain games, but it could take years as games take years to build.
- Kieran started investing more into Play to Earn as he gets pitches and is asked to be a seed investor.
- Guild of Guardians, Ember Swords and Star Atlas, Flappy Birds, Scifer are games that seem interesting to the panel

### [Illuvium trailer launch discord chat where Aaron joined]
- The three cofounders together hold a bit under 1.4 million ILV. They each hold the same amount, and because they're insanely competitive, neither will sell their tokens anytime soon because they would have less than the others
- If you fail to capture an illuvial, it will flee. but you keep your shard.
- You can do some things mid-combat, to juke opponents, like swap weapons.
- When it comes to combat, the stats of your ranger are determined by her equipped items
- There are already a dozen TFT pro's that contacted Aaron to get in the beta, they somehow caught wind of the 50 million tournament price.


### [Illuvium: Von Neumann Interview - The Lead Artist of Illuvium (Grant Warwick)!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpL6bqCCfU)
- artist since 15
- had an accident, had to wear an eye patch for months
- got a pc with burned dvds imported from japan with all kinds of software
- got a connection to a studio from Johhn singleton, a billionaire
- worked at a studio at 17 years old
- he left film industry and wanted to push photorealism in the print industry
- he was fully self-taught, didnt use tutorials online
- he made mastering CGI, and after he reached that pinnacle he got depressed
- kieran, grant and aaron are very complimentary in skills
- Grant is obsessed with mainstream art like marvel, he has marvel tattoos
- Grant doesn't like sidescrolling game
- Myst was a big in the Warwick family, they had a competition of who could finish Myst the first, and there were no guides back then
- he chose van Neumann because he was one of the smartest and most accomplished people ever
- he tried going fully anon within the studio with voice modulator, but it was just too hard to recruit top cgi talent
- norman bolau would be the other name he would have picked, inventor of gmo crops
- ILV is doing so many things differently (tokenomics, the way they do game development, the community they built-up before the game launches)
- they really want to make the next pokemon
- the reason they didnt do much gameplay in the trailer, is because they needed to pull people in first
- the writer on illuvium is called Cyrus, he writes it together with Aaron
- they make mistakes within the studio because theyre new, they sometimes decide to pull a month's work based on feedback
- if the game sucks, grant will put a screwdriver though aaron's head
- aaron is the least social, but he thinks differently and solves problems differently. Development team has a huge amount of respect for him. People are really trusting in knowing what he's doing.
- Other studios spend 4-7 years, they want to do it quickly, efficiently and fast, so they dont want to lose out on the motivation they've tapped into.
- underpaid top cgi artists, work 2 hours per day and the rest of the day on facebook
- they don't tell people to work long hours or weekends with very few exceptions. The people who got in early put in 10-12 hours per day because it is life changing for them, their output is godlike.
- they only have 2 juniors on the team, so it's like they are a 300 person team
- they were working on the trailer until the last minute
- they don't really make videos of the daily work, due to being so busy, but they have some video on balancer sale and this launch, they may make a documentary sometime
- the trailer had to go through 8 people's hands, if anything went wrong they were screwed
- they were at a retreat with friends for the trailer launch, and only had an ipad with them
- Grant is most passionate about biome and environment creation and environmental composition. He did some things that was implemented by others in the lion king movie
- people are sleeping on the environment.
- he hired people who love making plants
- the plants will all be animated and passive vfx
- some things wont be ready on release
- some plants are not interactive, but for immersion they want every plant to be interactive when you jump on it, shoot it, etc
- they are currently working heavily on 4 environments: sanctum mesa, crimson wastes, halcyon sea, brightland steppes (the one in the trailer)
- stage 1 penguin is named slappin(?), it's a penguin line of 3 stages
- they have over 30 characters nearing implementation
- they are blasting out hundreds of plant assets
- every texture is unique, they haven't bought a single one
- it's easier to start with something details
- they make every assets with 4-8k textures
- dimitry and grant know eachother from before, dmitry learned from grant and is now also bringing things to the new level
- the game looks a bit more polished is that they take full high ress cinematic workflow, and apply it to every asset.
- the biggest tasks grant has, is that if you play the game it looks like Illuvium
- Aaron doesn't let anything stand
- Aaron's desktop only has my computer, Grants desktop is full of icons
- the backend is super clean and smooth
- they need to build out the environment team to set dress the assets in the world, this is relatively quick work
- the weather or day/night doesn't change in real time, it will be randomly different though whenever you spawn into a region via the obelisk.
- they are going to start on release with 1 type of lighting scenario's for each of the biomes, and it's relatively quick process to add more lighting scenario's every time
- they want every biome to be completely unique
- abyssal basin is swamp bione
- they had an idea that in abyssal basin
- he wants to push brightland steppes into a jump puzzle region
- one of his biggest fears
- the autobattler is on lock, they still need to do a couple of things like chain attacks, mozart animations
- The autobattler already shits on teamfight tactics. 
- He is not an autobattler fan
- rocket league of the only game he played in the last 4-5 years
- the cinematic mode where you can pan the autobattler camera is inspired by rocket league
- if UE5 becomes stable and hard tested, he is more than happy to shift over. It won't look better, but will be a bit more optimised on the performance
- you don't need to have worked on AAA games to have expert UI/UX design. Florian has never worked on a game before, but he has learned himself how to implement UI in Unreal Engine
- Florian was working so hard on the trailer, he got arrested due to not renewing his visa
- he worked on the trailer with an ice bucket under the desk, due to tendonitis and working too hard
- he wants to get to a polished state for next march???
- he had people on the team early on who doubted that they would get 150 characters out, they are no longer on the team
- they are hiring 15 people every month
- they have been hesitant on adding easter eggs, because he wants the game to be about mechanics, not easter eggs
- Grant has woven in an easter egg that will be right under people's noses!
- Myst is his favorite game, so he will have something myst related in type of easter egg solving style
- if they had horizon forbidden west time and team size, they would make the overworld tomb raider and myst combined, and kept the autobattler the way it is
- the best thing they can do is start small and polish it, they refuse to make it a shitty bug fest
- he equates the play to earn to social media being invented
- each biome has its own unique battleboard. they have thoughts about skins for battle boards, but more realistically they will just add new biomes altogether
- the people who get the tier 5 land bases, will get their own battleboard
- grant will start modelling the leviathan arena in the cc-channel
- there will be a leviathan arena in every zone? it will be spooky and look like a UFC competitive arena. THe leviathan arena is the crashed hull of the ship in the trailer.
- they want to make it for tournaments, that the battleboard floats up for the final
- they will make variants for every zone, but they will not all be crashed spaceships
- each biome is a small segment within the larger biome. The edges of the zones will be sealed off by 
- when you start in the same in sanctum mesa, the obelisk isn't activated. The first person who activates it, will get an NFT of sanctum mesa, then it unlocks for everyone
- there will be overworld easter eggs, and things you have to do in the world
- it will be quite difficult to problem solve to find the first obelisk, it wont be discovered in the first 10 minutes
- for the next game, he wants the ability to see in the interface what he needs in his collection, and whenever another player catches the illuvial that you're looking for, it pops up a screen linking that user's profile and his collection. you will be able to disable it as a player if you dont want these popups
- there will be people making a game out of starting with 10 usd and trading up
- they want to have a leaderboard system that shows who has the number one character
- the swords will have different types, like watery sword, fiery sword
- they want everything to be polished and up to AAA standard
- expect that things will always keep improving
- he has calls with aaron that go for 3-4 hours
- his biggest fear on game launch is that people want more, that they havent added enough easter eggs
- Ben comes from RIOT and works with Aaron. He loves how fast his ideas get implemented
- every person they have hired come from a place where they are shackled to run free
- the studio kind of operates on a Monday-Friday schedule, but they work whenever they want. If they're not feeling it, theyre free to take time off. THey gotta hire the right people and trust that they will take time off when they need it.
- Kieran is just a troll when it comes to AXS, he does respect it
- They want to get to 300, 500, 1000 people working on the game. They want a movie, a netflix series and multiple games in development
- They got 130-140 people working
- if the members are not feeling it, they have the freedom to take the time off
- They could easily implement a pokemon Snap game
- you are on rails, just like pokemon Snap, you take photo's, and each photo is an NFT!!
- a game like pokemon snap doesn't have the longevity, but is siper easy to make
- Grant has always had 2 things on his bucket list: make a movie and make a game studio with his brothers
- Kieran is out there talking to investors all the time to see how far he can push it
- it took em 30 seconds to decide on locking the tokens
- they want to give revenue distributions to people who play the game well, like getting a high score, or something else
- kieran learned from mistakes 
- This game has so much going for it, the biggest revenue distribution will be a huge boon that Blizzard and EA will never do, the biggest esports tournament ever
- alex left ILM working on projects like Ready player One to move to thailand so he could go away from that mainstream culture
- people on the team have balls, they are already at the pinnacle of their careers
- there will be character customization at some point, but probably not on launch as it requires a little mini team
- alex created the character customization in All Points Bulletin
- they're about to go on a big big big hiring spree, high profile people
- a lot of artists want to work on something cool, doubling their salary isn't enough
- he hopes they've crossed the threshold to where people will go to them instead of ILV labs looking for people
- it's up to mainstream studios to keep up with them or buy it out
- one of their priorities is a solid backend that cant be botted or hacked
- there will be different boots, armor, shoulder pads, helmet, jet pack, mozart all as NFT's
- you can't push it too far with different armor pieces, otherwise it will like a clown suit
- the jet pack will also get bigger and more powerful
- how looking for and cap
- you see the illuvials in the overworld once you scan them. You have a visor which can pulse out an energy wave that picks up the signal of those singularities, you go hunt it down and shoot it, and it might be a ramphyre, but you don't know what it is until you shoot it. It warps like the rhino character in the trailer, the rhino character jumping into the singularity was arlend shooting it, it morphing from a character-like singularity into the character running, the tracking dart hits it and reveals it to be what the character is, it is then going to try and escape the overworld,it's going to jump into the warp (called singularity), and you've got a certain amount of time to follow it into the warp and chase it into the auto-battle. when you're in the autobattle, it will bring in more or less ally illuvials to fight you, depending on the level of the illuvial, and a little bit of rng
- they want to change the gameplay from biome to biome, so for some biomes you dont have a jetback.
- You don't want to scare the illuvials, so sometimes you want the jump on them with a jetpack
- there are 3 illuvials created after the 3 warwick brothers, that are apes. Kieran wanted the fighter, Grant the rogue, even though Grant is a boxer. Grilla is the one for Grant.
- they do details on the illuvials to the level of the water around the eyes of the iris!
- you have to tag the illuvial, but this doesn't let you know what it is. You can scan the singularity to find out the illuvial before the fight, but that costs energy. The more energy you use, it means you have to travel back to the region (after your energy is depleted). It costs money to travel back to the region. Whales can just scan everything right away
- Yannick and his wife Maria are two illuvium devs that are a couple, they made the fur animation
- They are working on making the illuvials animated so that if they are on a ledge their legs are bit crumbled up
- the holographic shaders for the NFT's are his masterpiece. Holographics are the holy grail of cgi industry
- the holographic shaders are inspired by marvel cards that kain used to collect. Grant has also spent a long time being obsessed with holographic Pokemon cards
- the maker of the software that he used to make the holo effect told him it was impossible to make it dynamic
- He just got drunk and blasted for 20 hours and did it! When he showed dmitriy he couldnt believe it. Grant would have quit if he couldnt manage the shaders, since to him the holographic cards are what fascinated him the most
- he is holding back some of the holo effects for launch
- he has a 5k screen and is slowly rendering each NFT to be holographic as it comes through the pipeline
- Each NFT is rendered in full 4k as a holo, dark holo and something else beyond that that is still secret!!!
- To get this third special level of holo, you have to combine the other ones!
- the NFT's are way more complex than the in game sort of holo
- they dont have enough rendering power to render all the holos. They have been using Chaos Group's rendering farm. They have 8 supercomputers at their offices, but the frames. The shaders are so complex it takes 12 hours for 1 frame. You have 300 frames for every NFT. He spoke to Danny who is the financial guy, and said if they want to finish the NFT's before launch, they have to invest in a 1-2 million dollar render farm just to render out the NFT's in time for launch.
- You can't reproduce that shader. He knows more about V-ray shaders than anyone else in the world
- Grant also designed the logo
- Atlas is not the first Illuvial. There is an actual first illuvial (kind of like Mewtwo?) that Aaron came up with the story of.
- Some illivials fly!
- Some illuvials have a different number of legs
- They came up with the Lynx series, which is a little big like Eevee. There are like 30 evolutions, this allows them to develop them a bit faster and get to 150 illuvials
- there is no hard set 'Illuvial x doesnt drop in this region', they are on a bonding curve, but some regions have higher chances to get certain illuvials
- Grant has broken Kieran's ribs after he was pushing him to hard and bruising his arm trying to pump him up
- Grant has also broken Kain's ribs a long time ago
- There is a silly Snail illuvial that is Grant's favorite Illuvial.

### [Illuvium / ILV IS THE TOP CRYPTO GAME!! 💰 (Kieran Warwick interviewed by Taps Trades)!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TboZfw_qCUw)
- The game design document is 2000 pages
- The storyline is so detailed and good that Kieran guarantees they will make a movie out of it
- He wants to turn it into the modern age Pokemon. Kieran prefers movie, Grant Netflix
- They are trying to build a franchise that will last the ages
- when you start out, you get a free shard (tier 0 shard) and capture illuvials (even tier 5??)
- You can start with no capital, leveling up the tier 0s, and sell them on the marketplace
- To travel around, you pay a fee in ETH or sILV, but it wont be a massive fee, mainly to stop botting
- As you mine, you need to cure the shards. Tier 0-5
- If you try to the high level regions, you wanna use tier 5 charts.
- A Rhamphyre is potentially tens of thousands of dollars
- The winner in the arena gets 95% of the betted amount, 5% cut
- Some other crypto games discord claim they have 150 people, but only 6 devs are online. It is a huge pain to recruit artists who think crypto is a scam.
- Kieran wants to have the best graphics, the best gameplay, the best storyline
- There are 5 game designers. THey are already starting to think about what a moba looks like
- Aaron is not going to stop designing game after game. He has found his calling in life.
- Kieran is an eth maxi, he believes ETH will win the smart contract battle
- Periodically, but not weekly because they dont want it to be frontran, they are buying ILV off the market
- He mentions buying 50 million of ILV on sushiswap
- If you get the ILV from the revdis, you can sell it or stake it further for revdis
- A lot of people have switched to sILV claiming to prepare for the land sale
- Kieran is going deep on the sale, he's buying as many plots as he can
- The higher tiers, the more resource spots you
- Tier 1 land: 3 element sides and 1 fuel side
- Tier 2 land: 6 element sides and 3 fuel sides
- Tier 3 land: 9 element sides and 6 fuel sides + element landmarks
- Tier 4 land: even more
- Tier 5 land: most resources + an arena on your land
- There are 3 fuels that are sold into something like a balancer liquidity pool, containing ETH and the 3 fuels. The people on the other sides require this fuel from illuvium zero to do all their things like cure shards. The price of curing shards will fluctuate based on how much fuel the land owners supply, but a small percentage so they cant be like opec.
- The land game is an idle clicker that is easier to play
- According to Kieran, being a land owner could be more lucrative than staking!
- If many plots are together, they can produce a megacity that gives extra rewards
- Land will be Dutch auction, there will be 20,000 land plots. It will start like a balancer sale. They are starting the pricing higher than they think it is worth
- Do not fomo in right away, wait for the price to drop
- They are hopeful to get the pricing of the land plots by the end of next week

### [Illuvium / ILV IS THE TOP CRYPTO GAME!! 💰 (Kieran Warwick interviewed by Taps Trades)!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TboZfw_qCUw)
- There will be plants you can harvest
- On the day of trailer launch, Aaron saw it 17 times because the team is so perfectionist they wanted to polish and fix tiny things
- Kain and Aaron used to get Kieran and Grant into a ring and made them fight
- Aaron can't control Grant nor Kieran
- illuvial wake - is the bubbly shadow thing on the ground
- They will start to output a lot more of the overworld gameplay now that the story is out
- You catch the illuvials in the world, then you have to bring them into the zero-point forge? to fuse 3 identical illuvials together for its evolution
- its not like the trailer where you evolve it during a battle with a player, you evolve it before the battle and bring it into your deck
- meta builds dont always work, you want to walk on the tightrope of building a deck that is decent against everything, or a deck that counters the opponent
- the rhino in the trailer gets hit by the tracking guard, then it tries to escape into a singularity. You want to hit them with the tracking dart at distance.
- For the public beta, you wont see the physical illuvials, you see the wakes, but there's a story element why you see the wakes in the world instead of the actual real illuvials
- a wake is an illuvial moving in a different plane then you
- if you shoot it with a quantum tracking dart, it will then flee into the encounter space (singularity), and you have to follow it to prevent it from fleeing
- the singularity is the portal that illuvials leave behind when they get spooked
- when you try to fuse 3 holo's, the evolution will be a holo too. You can also fuse 1 holo with 2 non-holo's, but the chances of getting a holo evolution is much smaller
- the encounter rates for holo or dark holo havent been decided, but a charizard is 1/10,000 cards, so the chances of finding the hardest thing to find is somewhere in that vicinity
- you can encounter stage 2's and 3's in the wild
- anything you find has a percentage chance to be holo. Most people will get a chance to get a holo stage 3 to catch a whole bunch of holos
- the area in the trailer is brightland steppes stage 1
- you cant get really rare drops if you dont pay money
- there are tier 0 verions of the regions, that dont cost anything, and you capture illuvials with tier 0 shards, which dont cost anything to mine
- there are 75 distinct types of tier 0 illuvials. There is 5 characters that have 5 affinities, that have stage 1,2,3 -> 5x5x3 = 75
- you can't spend no money and find something really rare, otherwise people would bot
- it will still take quite a lot of time to find tier 0 illuvials
- there are 2 weapons in the trailer, the pistal and the sword that gives the character a water essence
- the companion drone you get off the bat, it will be very important
- the companion drone is polymorphic, it can change. It doesnt start as mozart
- the jumping mechanic is easy to learn, medium to master
- you have a set amount of kinetic that you use while flying, jumping, sprinting, using your nether scythe
- in most games you jump instantly with space key, in this one you charge and release
- they plan to add backflips and sideflips to the jumps if you do it perfectly

It scales of the two bases separately. 
The bonuses synergies but don’t rely on each other. 
Playing multiple of the dual gives a new thing that enhances BOTH the base things.

Play 1 dual - you get the stacks and you get treated a lot like the base. 
Play 2 or more dual - get new bonuses
Play heavy in one base - Dual acts more like that base. 
Play heavy in both - dual is a god (but you spent all your points and your opponent can counter you)](https://discord.com/channels/760344898200666112/791148476218081321/911982909345374228)

### [Illuvium interview 13 Nov 2021 Grant Warwick - Volkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns7FwBEwOi4)
- The team gets paid in tokens, Grant views salary as slave labour
- Aaron is a freak at organization, which is how he got Harvey Norman to go from a small scale retailer to a big retailer through management and making things run clean.
- Aaron makes sure the work from home has worked well because he organized the workflows so well
- Aaron has re-organized the google drive filesystem 5 times to make it perfect. Everything is tagged, every asset has a concept sheet
- They want a really fun movement system. The overworld is a combination of jumping puzzles, and making sure you can reach the illuvials before they run away in the void
- They are balancing things now so that even if you dont have magboots and jetpack you can still reach certain areas
- the beetle rhino in the trailer is called titanel
- the reason you dont see the illuvials in the world in their own form is due to bots
- the bot will only be able to scan a certain amount, since it costs energy to scan it
- After you scan a singularity, you still need to shoot it with a dart
- The gun carries 3 darts, you can only shoot 3 before you have to craft new darts
- If you shoot a singularity with a tracking dart, the singularity morphs into an illuvial, and then it will try to run off into a void, and you have to run into it too before it closes
- the illuvial might run off into a void that you cant reach before your magboots arent good enough
- you won't know that it's holographic once you scan it. You will only know whether it's a holographic when you shoot it with a tracking dart and the void becomes a holographic void
- they havent decided yet whether the holographic void contains just 1 holographic or if the whole team is holographic
- In the trailer the protagonist is trying to gather water and earth illuvials to counter the fire opponent
- The portals that come when you shoot a singularity with a tracking dart will be randomly generated locations to prevent botting
- Different illuvials have different characteristics. Some illuvials are really slow, so the portal will be close and close quickly to balance it out
- The overworld will be a bit limited because the team size is not big enough, they hope the autobattler and crypto elements make up for it. THey are lagging behind in the overworld
- They have 400 plants for brightland steppes
- They want to balance the overworld for the movement the players have. Grants focus will be on the set dressing of the overworld and the leviathan arena
- They have cool-headed team members when it comes to the price
- Rogier was one of the most incentivized team members and for 6 months he didnt realize he had tokens and he didnt care
- They dont have a good idea of expectation of how players will play the game
- The game will launch in Q1 2022 as an open beta
- There are some integrations with the digital marketplace that axie doesnt have, it will expand further from axie's level
- Kieran is talking to investors right now to raise capital to speed up the mobile part
- Grant grew up on Crysis, and that was the first game that captures the CGI level. A friend of his was working on Crysis
- The very first trailer (months ago) was hacked together by dmitry and grant a couple of animators and texture artists in 9 days.
- The artists on the recent trailer got instant gratification
- The three sound guys are freaks. Nico, T-bow (who comes from AAA games) and Vince are the sound team. They had to wing the sound guys hiring a bit because they dont know how to judge a sound portfolio
- Tbow wants the sound to be better than Diablo 4, which is the game currently with the best sound
- Kain helped the brothers financially to make the game happen. The brothers feel huge responsibility to live up to Kains reputation and not harm his project
- some of the mechanics of the game are coming out (in the next weeks/months?)
- Aaron came up with the idea of having the first set being endangered/extinct animals to be the inspiration of Illuvium
- The team uses Kena bridge of spirits as inspiration and benchmark for the areas
- Some of the team members follow Volkins content and love seeing their recent work reviewed

[Grant livestream](https://youtu.be/usSuDqAhUQs?t=4849)
- it will take about 40-60 minutes to run through a zone and capture all minerals/plants.

[Illuvium CEO interview | Biggest Metaverse Play-To-Earn Game of 2022 Kieran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTgHxvcBhas)
- They just hired their 180th person
- They are potentially looking into layer 2 solutions
- Illuvatars base layer will be 15 nfts, but you have accessory slots
- Illuvium is talking with large scale influencers (Pewdiepie level), they want to strike at the right time
- They are open to having a partnership with large scale partners. 60% of pokemon revenue comes from merch
- They have an internal joke with Axie infinity, he didnt want to disclose it

[Grant interview vetemor]
- The artists get a good salary, plus they got the tokens at 3$
- Out of the three brothers, Aaron works the hardest

[Polemos interview Kieran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwwf-QHrpTc)
- Damage from exploit will be refunded by wallets from Kieran, Grant and Aaron
- claiming damage may not be on IMX, potentially a different L2 solution if they build a bridge to IMX
- Kieran has a different idea for those who have a march unlock
- it is not off the plans to buy out the sell pressure
- Kieran wants Illuvium to expand into a moba (I think he means MMO) where you fight a ginormous leviathans, they will be like raid bosses. you go in with groups of 8 and take down the bosses into an ultra ultra autobattle
- they havent yet decided the amount of illuvials per set and the time interval between genesis set and second set. Probably every 12 months and 50-100 illuvials per set
- there will possibly be a ILZ trailer, possibly a illuvatars trailor, and definitely a mega end of release trailer
- there was an outsourcing company that did a great job on the trailer, Kieran is in talks to bring them on fulltime, so it can do trailers for all Illuvium's big events
- as we enter the open beta, there will be a trailer and as we end the beta there will be a trailer too

[Kieran Warwick interview Illuvium](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdxBvjloyWc)
- over 1.5 million people have signed up for the beta
- The hardest part of getting Framework was convincing Aaron is a good game designer.
- Aaron had built a 1200 game design doc and Kieran showed it to people from the gaming space, nate wells from bioshock and he said it was amazing
- Kieran wants to make either a MOBA or MMO for the next Illuvium game. MMO with raid bosses in teams of 6
- Aaron has got like 15 years of game ideas, thats the benefit of him never actually releasing his own games.

[Aaron discord 20 april 2022]
- Aaron has plans for 5 more games
- The team will propose whatever game they think is best and that they are most excited to make over games which would be most ILV accretive, but whales and the public may choose something else.
- Aaron thinks people are stupid, but the whole population in aggregate will make the decision that is best for Illuvium.


[Illuvium land sale discord ama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd7eV5hQU7M)
- the game, as in Overworld and Arena, will be actively worked on for 2-3 years to get them to a really polished state
- there will be a huge group of players constantly trying to improve their deck, so they can earn prize money. They wont primarily do it to make money with selling NFTs
- They are treating ILV like a card collecting game, but you can flip a switch and those cards can be used in a real time strategy game, so your NFTs have multiple use cases in multiple game, which reduced the pump and dump
