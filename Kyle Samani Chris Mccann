chris is excited about zeta options en saber
chris likes allbridge, jupiter

kyle seems not that bullish about cross-chain
- ux issues

chris says bridges will eat up more of the downstream chains. Bijv allbridge laat je staken in marinade zodat je niet zelf naar marinade hoeft te gaan

kyle thinks one chain will dominate, there will be other chains but they are small
