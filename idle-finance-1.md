# Notes:
- Compared to YFI, IDLE focuses more on the efficiency of total allocation, rather than putting a lot into whatever is highest apy today
- IDLE will create tranches that are flexible funds you can move in and out of. This distinguishes them from other tranche providers like barnbridge and pendle
- IDLE's community is similar to Index where you have working groups that the token holders vote on
- IDLE also looks are cross-chain yield opportunities
- IDLE sees itself as a treasury service for B2B and B2DAO
