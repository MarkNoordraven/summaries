They plan to offer USDC-USDT to B2B
Upsides and downsides of LP:

* They plan to offer USDC-USDT to B2B
* Upsides and downsides of stablecoin LP:
  * Upsides
    * In a bear market, people will still need to swap their stablecoins, but there is much less demand for stable-crypto swaps. LP on stables is safer.
  * Downsides
    * In a bull market providing stablecoin liquidity to something like Aave will generally be higher yield.
* In a directional market, crypto-crypto pairs provide better returns than stablecoin pairs
* One could also go long a crypto-crypto pair + short vol to remain neutral
* The future of Popsicle Finance is to provide non-directional strategies by going long LP and shorting one side of the pair in a completely decentralized way
* LP can also be used to dollar cost average as a strategy while still earning LP fees in case you want to cash out without paying sell fees. You're not paying fees for being a net seller or net buyer
* 51:54: Alpha time: apes.win by margin/leveraged trading through abracadabra, integrations for scale orders margin buy for NFT's and LPs will Popsicle and Abracadabra. So they will provide everything a trader wants to do.
* Supporting Myst-ETH UniV3 pool custom strat for more illiquid assets
* Tokenomics: 10% cut on LP sorbetto fees to buy ICE to give to nICE holders in the future, and perhaps burn ICE, up to governance
* Crucible allows you to stake in a non-custodial kind of way
* Certora does formal verification audits
* Reasons for multi-chain LP incentives: deep liquidity pairs BSC FTM will be migrated to Limone
* Limone FTM will harvest all the FTM across all exchanges and buy ICE in addition to all the ICE bought with LP fees
* ICE staking incentives are not planned on ending until there's a date
* Once fragola is out, there will be buying pressure on ICE to counteract the staking selling pressure
* sandwiched.wtf shows you how much you lost from sandwich attacks, but only works for Uni V3?
* The bigger the project gets, the more frontrunning. Mystx can pay miners to get FR protection
* There will be a 9 key multisig, holders spread across the world, daniele and squirrel and georgi and vitale(?) also get a key but team will be minority of multi-sig. Ceazor is also multi-sig member
* On Myst-X you pay no gas, but pay a miner tip
* You will be able to deposit different amounts in to the LP pairs (zap 0/100, 30/70, 50/50)
* Sorbetto isn't risk free, impermanent loss could outweigh the gains
* For a rebalance, only part of the UniV3 pool amount gets pulled out to rebalance
* Visor's strategies on V3 are too complex, and cause too much IL, you need to find a balance between active and passive
* Visor is custodial and could rug
* When the markets go down, some protocols that aren't in it for the long term could rug you
* Soon the USDC-USDT pair can be used as collateral in Abracadabra
* In the future, you can take badger LP, MIM-alcETH LP accruing the same rewards in the crucible and lever that whole crucible with all LP's in one pool
* They will work with badger and others to help them cope with the liquidity needs
* V3 LP's fragola on top of abracadabra
* when daniele was 19 in London, he had some hard times where he could only afford 95p chicken mcnuggets and reused his cup to get water from the toilet.
