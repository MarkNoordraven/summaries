## Questions to Noah Seidman to answer on his daily stream:
- You mentioned liking the recent Raoul interview, but his investment style seems focused on capital appreciation, not recurring revenue. What do you think of his views?
- You mentioned getting a small allocation to BOO, and even though staking BOO seems interesting, at the same time Spookyswap is minting a lot of BOO for to incentivize their farms. How did you decide the net effect?
- Could you explain how you decided between BOO and SPIRIT? They seem reasonably similar.
