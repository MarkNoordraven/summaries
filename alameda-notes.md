[Profit Maximalist - Sam Trabucco](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/profit-maximalist/the-real-driver-of-last-w0L7KjNzS1P/)
- Alameda has a stream of all liquidations, and they just watch it and wait until it sort of stops, that's when they want to buy agressively
- by volume, most trades are done by bots
- they keep an eye on the bots all the time
- there haven't been enough crashes to optimize an algorithm, so they don't trust the bots during idiosyncratic situations
- they analyze literally everything they could be doing with their money and what the EV of each would be, then pick the highest EV
- they also consider having sitting around money doing nothing, so in case of a crash they have a lot of money to deploy, for making the best trades and top up collateral
- having free capital allows them to put on higher leveraged trades
- they estimate the probability that a big crash will happen, how much they make on average if it happens
- it is quite high EV having capital sitting around doing nothing. THey don't even put it in sushiswap or something
- it does require having a good plan of what to do with the capital when the market crashes, it will be low EV if you misallocate it
- it can be good for an average investor to have 25% in cash to spend in case of a crash, IF you allocate it right
- everything has a beta to bitcoin
- alameda checks their beta to bitcoin for all their positions, then add it all up to get their crypto exposure
