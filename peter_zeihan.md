[Geopolitical Strategist Peter Zeihan, the man who predicted Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQL_KCvBkk4)
- all but 2 pipelines will be destroyed by the russians or ukranians.
- the remaining pipelines are under the black sea (nordstream) and under the black sea (blue stream). 
- Russia will tell germany and turkey they will keep the oil flowing, as long as they make sure NATO cant defend Ukraine.
- there will be an oil crisis, as russian oil cant be transported across sea/rails due to insurers pulling out
- oil will be 170-200. Joe Biden will stop all crude oil exports. US oil price will go to 70, rest of the world to 300 first, then demand destruction, then 150
- russia is largest fertilizer and third largest wheat
- Q4 we will see global wheat prices quadruple
- countries like britain, denmark, spain, italy, germany will cut deals with arab and african countries

[Energy security cubed]zeihan new
-RU sees UKR as beginning of the war
- Drusba pipeline will be gone in 3m
- Germany no refineries near river/sea
- Ships wont ship due to no insurance
- remaining port has no deep sea capabilities, which will ake 30+ years to get them to break
- everyone is cutting RUssian energy out, even germany.
- EU will not protect waters for russian ships, so insurers wont insure them, so they cant sail
- remaining RUssian port has no deep sea capabilities, only small ships
- In 2 months RU need to stop production, will will take 30+ years to get production back due to permafrost
- 70-80 dollar crude oil in US tops, 175+dollar oil minimum for the rest of the world
- we're gonna see an explosion in refinery capacity in the US, as they will abuse US' cheap oil and export refined products at a premium
- there will be internal arbitrage in US too, since Cali oil prices will be higher than the rest of US
- There is 590k barrel per day pipeline from canada to cali (TSA)?
- EU will talk to african colonies to get crude. China loses out
- China has an issue, lockdown due to crappier vaccine, only facilities that produce are the ones that keep their workers captive
- RU oil needs to be refined by the west, before CN can use it
- CN will have structural energy shortage for several years
- XI is insulated, he has scared or killed anymore close to him.
- CN wont be a nation state in 8 years
- Ukraine is way easier to invade than Taiwan
- Sanctions RU if applied to CN would kill CN because they're a food and energy importer
- the new book starts from the pov post-china and post-middle east

[RT radio 1 IAB]
- RU half water transport goes through warzone -> no insurance
- RU ports have shallow water
- in summer 2022, wells will freeze
- 5-6 million barrels per day are never coming back as RU production reduces
- changing oil for gas is useless for EU countries like Austria  that are land locked
- UKR would be in blackout if EU didn't connect them to their grid
- whole germano-centric manufacturing system is screwed if Germany can't get energy
- EU stopped making feritilizer due to natural gas requirement
- we're going back to 1880 instead of 1950
- RU largest wheat exporter, UKR 4th largest wheat exporter
- RU is destroying infrastructure of Ukraine
- Wheat doubled so far, but will go 3-4x due to black sea port embargo
- lower margin crops are already not being fertilized due to being too expensive
- venezuela can't increase oil production for 5 years even if chevron took over the country
- Iran can push production by 400k-1m bpd if sanctions are dropped
- US will end oil exports, making the situation even worse for the rest of the world
- EU is more united and cohesive than they have been in 300 years
- If Austrians, germans and EU can't get aligned before energy stops, EU will break apart because some countries have no power


[Real vision interview]
- brazil may break apart
- any country that relies on an external input to function has issues
- expect significant degradation in eastern hemisphere
- us, india, indonesia, malaysia is benefitting from china's breakup. Chunks of manufacturing will be up for grabs and certain countries are well positioned to take advantage of that.


[WW3 is just the beginning | feat. Peter Zeihan | Global Macro #12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYZGlmX6HXY&t=8s)
- Before WW2, you had different systems that didn't trade.
- US created free trade, so colonies were able to become specialized
- We went off the farm into cities, which increased industrialization and dropped birth rates
- This decade we will have investment drop, production drop, consumption bust
- we are not going back to normal
- china won't exist by 2030
- CN and ukraine are biggest losers in this momvement
- CN population peaked 2002, they have overcounted their population by 100m people
- for thriving stock sector, you need a lot of capital and highly educated young people
- US produces 55% semiconductors by value
- 10+ semiconductors from CN
- CN subsidizes manufacturing because it's more about the labour participation than the profit
- CN navy can only sail 1000 miles (vietnam)
- To beat CN, it is easy to cut their energy supply by blocking naval routes, they will be in famine in 12 months
- we're at the edge of the globalized era
- 30% chance CN will invade tW
- If russian sanctions were placed on China, it would destroy CN in months
- if foreign companies leave CN, CN is screwed
- XI has intimidated all his intelligence. Thats why the covid lockdowns are so bad. He has noone to talk to except 12 people, 6 of which he trusts
- Putin lied to Xi about the invasion
- CN subs are not missile capable
- RU subs are monitored.
- China have to go through strait which is visually and with boeys monitors
- Russia brought Wagner group, syrian and chechan militaries to go block to block and kill everone.
- Russia is trying to block the gaps, they want to get past Ukraine
- Fight between US and RU forces is destined to happen. RU has to retreat or escalate to nukes.
- RU sees this as existential crisis
- FUel will be concern in war. Choppers require fuel, supply chains needed
- We're moving to a grey area as we are giving more and more support. At some point RU will call BS and say NATO is helping RU
- RU is getting > 1 billion USD per day in sales to EU
- In times of war the state tends to weaken because they have to throw a wider net for support
- at least half the world will be food insecure
- US can grow through all of these problems, and even there states will get additional power
- EU has to become neocolonial if they want to survive and keep the lights on.
- Pie is going to get smaller due to population collapse
- northern and western european democracy can go out and get what they need, but southern and central eu is screwed
- food, finance, raw material energy is what you need. Democracy is getting stronger as labour gets higher wages
- Cut internet cables, disabled cell towers.
- RU has kill switches on all 4 internet cables entering RU
- CN has food insecurity issue due to not getting african swine flu from herd, energy issue due to Russia
- most of the worlds smallest stock markets will go away
- stocks require stable sysem with a lot of liquidity, wont exist
- bonds will be the way governments and big companies raise funding. Since need for money will be massive, there will be high supply and not many capital providers, so it's a buyers market
- Be prepared for at least the mid 70's and the immediate aftermath of the oil crisis. It will probably never be that good
- metal-backed currencies have been so successfull it always leads to wars. Fiat is about trust, not many countries with trust each other. USD remains king
- EU has shown it was willing to manipulate value euro, countries don't trust that
- EU doesnt have consumers. If there is any hope that europe wont fall back to 1945, the euro needs to stay alive. Recent unitedness was promising, but he thinks EU will disintegrate back into nation states with national currency.
- digital currency is moving to being controlled by sovereign
- crypto can only work if it has interfaces with the real economy and is liquid in its exchange
- crypto cant be a currency because noone is in control of the money supply
- bitcoin is the worst example
- crypto is not a store of value nor medium of exchange
- gold has all the negatives of crypto (like limited supply), but with 1 exception: it exists and will always have a base value due to having industrial uses
- bitcoin has negative value because of low carbon movement
- global warming isn't a big issue, as long as we have enough water. Plants can withstand 10 degree celcius increase if they get enough water.
- zeihan invests in long term trends
- things that are in very large markets with deep pools of liquidity (US)
- products that are energy intensive in production
- products that have demand that is demographically driven
- product that needs to be exported due to arb US navy
- Supply chains globally break down, but US supply chains get stronger, so you want to abuse US supply chains
- also bullish on things that we need to produce things that are no longer coming from RU; bauxite, aluminum, titanium, steel, pig iron, wheat, nitrogen-based fertilizers, fosfate based fertilizers. US firm not exposed to soviet union
- you cant invest in global funds, you have to go more specific.
- period of bottomless supplies of capital are ending
- we're gonna have fewer financial professionals
- high frequency trading, ETFs, broad index funds dont work in this environment
- cost of capital will rise. 
- You have to do your homework, you can't rely on CFA anymore
- US and Mexico will be able to tinker with existing system for 30 years. EU and asia will change significantly in terms of economic and political models in the next 30 years
- energy crisis, food crisis, financial crisis
- food is his number 1 concern. 
- agriculture cant be specialized anymore, bringing wheat back to the core of the production system. No issue for US, but for the rest it will
- we're already deep in breakdown fertilizer
- simply mapping production of each country to each country's needs is going to reduce calories the world grows by more than half!
- in the best case scenario, no wars, we already have
- US, france, austrialia, argentina (if they can get their head out of their ass) will be okay agri wise











[Dan Carr show]()
end of ww2 people moved off of farm into higher value jobs
manufacturing jobs in town -> less kids, but not smaller population, it takea 50 year
china 75% of pop expansion from 1980 to 2020 was from lifespan increase, but number children age or shrink
germany italy belgium korea already have huge demographic issues
NL, thailand, brazil next wave of demographic issues

chinese population bomb was happening regardless of one child policy and female abortions
china collapsing this decade

no global trade -> less export

globalization means food, energy input can go to every country
industrialization not possible without these inputs. Mainly electricity and food

terminal deindustrialization
terminal depopulation

lots of countries of diamond shaped demographic period
japan korea taiwan thaland, germany, belgium, italy belarus will vanish over next century due to no ppl, unless they redefine themselves like austrialia

some countries neet inputs from other side of world and dont have population or navy to get their inputs. CHina and germany top of list
europe more united since westfalia

germany can choose between deindustrializing and siding with russia and have the energy for industry

globalization doesnt mean end of gadgets. smartphone is issue
agriculture is issue, american producers are so effective they have to export surplus, leading to weird stuff
tech manufacturing requires different labor salary scales. Asia has 1 to 10 difference in salary, USA doesnt have such a big delta unless they get colombia to do low end
cellphone high end chips are us made, but all other stuff are china or korea centric. Korea has a tendency to change their whole culture, they may be able to shift although PZ doesnt know how
apple is screwed. They double down on CN. apple ecosystem can disappear until they relocate their supply chain in 5 years. next release will be last one

canary in coalmine: watch how europeans deal with pensions. Increasing retirements with reduced tax base. Germany retires 2026. Pension funds have ballooned but are coming down. THey become debt driven society.

Canary: china supply chain. EVery time china screws up, another country step in and replace them. Early movers who moved manuf away from china are profiting now

breakthrough tech that could save us: nothing for manufacturing. Short-run stuff with additive machine shops close to populations. You cant speed it up plus labour constrained.
agriculture could break through with gmo and face recognition for plants, take photos on each plant, hit fertilizer or pesticide with 1 run. You need 3 runs per season instead of 16 with organics.

FOr large row crop fields this could increase production by 200% by 2025. You need US with finance and large land plots, or countries like Francy where government subsidizes farms

Manufacturing touches thousands of countries

agriculture tractors and heavy machinery also have big supply chains. we need system with shorter steps closer to end consumer
this could work in south east asia or europe if they can get materials in
USA has 33% of glbal population consumption, but can also colocate with population centers, this is new norm
Jersey already has industrial spaces and warehouses, they only need machine shops

as baby boomers retire, we are losing largest part of financial capacity. green tech needs lot of financing, since upfront cost is 60% OF TOTAL COST
fossil fuel is 25% of lifetime costm, so easier in easy money
finance rates are gonna increase 5-15%, so things which require a lot of finance are screwed until 2040s when boomers die and millennial kids have money
making solar cells is easy, assembly requires a lot of cheap labour. Maybe colombia, already free trade treaty and high education for their standard of living

china manufacturing model may collapse this year. they overcounted by 100 million ppl. they were fastest aging, fasted collapsing demographics. china will collapse as a nation state this decade.

oil from russia to china comes from eastern siberia, western companies left so russians cant bring energy from those places to china. china is at mercy of usa

we had perfect environment for china last 50 years

capital cost has been lower, then everyone builds out everything. china was able to develop with a speed that noone can match. now labour, mats, financial costs are higher they cant repeat this

folks who have better cash flows, connections and better economics make it through, rest is screwed

hes not financial advisor.
bitcoin is odd thing that pops up when capital is cheap and available, wont be part of financial architecture
gold is weird, fear play and theres a lot of fear, but also industrial uses. too wiggly
he is looking for thinfs that are american domiciled, american inputs, amerian customer base, usa has cheapest electricity, product portable is great
energy processing and food processing in shorter supply wider world
crypto currency idea that digital asset behind it and digital dollar is good idea
fed will take a while with digital currency. will probably be account at fed, banks screwed

skills that individuals to develop:
-learn spanish, will be 2nd language of western hemisphere
-we need to go back into blue collar, as baby boomers retire. Electricians and plumbers have been discriminated against for 40 years.
1st year plumbers will eaen 85000 dollars per year in their first year
industrialization is good for very high end and very low end of skills
this will go away, 3d printing computer designs machine shops that do low runs. Micromanufacturing, custom manufacturing. New Jersey is perfect

3d printing could help reduced supply chains. 3d printing issue is lack of speed and high cost. 3d printing complex part with 1 run, with injection mold or dye cast is 15 runs

3d printting parts is gonna reduce number of parts by 2/3

russian advance has stalled. he expects russian mobilization. limiting factor is how quick each side can bring equipment into battlefront. raytheon can only produce 2000 javelins per year, it takes a year to ramp production up to 4000. germany is running out of stuff to send, else they have nothing to defend themselves
some precision guided weapons will help ukraine a lot, but it will go against the mass assault, russia has 100k troops in ukraine but can bring 2 million troops.
russia will loose war of attrition
russian space has a lot of gaps, they need to concentrate forces into the gaps to defend. They attack now because this is the last generation that can field an army big enough. next time they will have small army to defend huge frontier.
Ukraine is doing everything they can. There are a lot of fires in russian military facilities, may be sabotage by ukraine, or because westerners left and russians are bad at safety

russia needs to plug bessarabian gap, moldova, estonia, poland, etc
when russie fights nato, they will be humiliated and need to retreat back to border. then they will use nukes. Thats why we need to kill the entire russian army in Ukraine

baby boomers tend to favour 2-income 

we had 2 big bursts of inflation

60's: industrial demand driven inflation
80's: consumer demand driven inflation
baby boomers no longer in peak consuming years, and not enough gen x. Chinese entered market, reduced cost of labour. Baby boomers became 2-income families, also reduce cost of labour
russia raw material did not collapse with ussr collapse, which reduced industrial cost

russian stuff is going away
millennials aege out.
every inflationary thing is returning now, and every deflationary thing is flipping.
This inflation will last until we shift industrial base, earliest 2027

afghanistan has only be a country for as long as the countries around it have been in breakdown. As long
