- all but 2 pipelines will be destroyed by the russians or ukranians.
- the remaining pipelines are under the black sea (nordstream) and under the black sea (blue stream). 
- Russia will tell germany and turkey they will keep the oil flowing, as long as they make sure NATO cant defend Ukraine.
- there will be an oil crisis, as russian oil cant be transported across sea/rails due to insurers pulling out
- oil will be 170-200. Joe Biden will stop all crude oil exports. US oil price will go to 70, rest of the world to 300 first, then demand destruction, then 150

- Germany no refineries near river/sea
- Ships wont ship due to no insurance
- remaining port has no deep sea capabilities, which will ake 30+ years to get them to break
- everyone is cutting RUssian energy out, even germany.
- EU will not protect waters for russian ships, so insurers wont insure them, so they cant sail
- remaining RUssian port has no deep sea capabilities, only small ships
- In 2 months RU need to stop production, will will take 30+ years to get production back due to permafrost
- 70-80 dollar crude oil in US tops, 175+dollar oil minimum for the rest of the world
- we're gonna see an explosion in refinery capacity in the US, as they will abuse US' cheap oil and export refined products at a premium
- there will be internal arbitrage in US too, since Cali oil prices will be higher than the rest of US
- There is 590k barrel per day pipeline from canada to cali (TSA)?
- EU will talk to african colonies to get crude. China loses out
- China has an issue, lockdown due to crappier vaccine, only facilities that produce are the ones that keep their workers captive
- RU oil needs to be refined by the west, before CN can use it
- CN will have structural energy shortage for several years
- XI is insulated, he has scared or killed anymore close to him.
- CN wont be a nation state in 8 years
- Ukraine is way easier to invade than Taiwan
- Sanctions RU if applied to CN would kill CN because they're a food and energy importer
- the new book starts from the pov post-china and post-middle east

[RT radio 1 IAB]
- RU half water transport goes through warzone -> no insurance
- RU ports have shallow water
- in summer 2022, wells will freeze
- 5-6 million barrels per day are never coming back as RU production reduces
- changing oil for gas is useless for EU countries like Austria  that are land locked
- UKR would be in blackout if EU didn't connect them to their grid

- RU is destroying infrastructure of Ukraine
- Wheat doubled so far, but will go 3-4x due to black sea port embargo
- lower margin crops are already not being fertilized due to being too expensive
- venezuela can't increase oil production for 5 years even if chevron took over the country
- Iran can push production by 400k-1m bpd if sanctions are dropped
- US will end oil exports, making the situation even worse for the rest of the world
- EU is more united and cohesive than they have been in 300 years
- If Austrians, germans and EU can't get aligned before energy stops, EU will break apart because some countries have no power


[Real vision interview]
- brazil may break apart
- any country that relies on an external input to function has issues
- expect significant degradation in eastern hemisphere
- us, india, indonesia, malaysia is benefitting from china's breakup. Chunks of manufacturing will be up for grabs and certain countries are well positioned to take advantage of that.


[WW3 is just the beginning | feat. Peter Zeihan | Global Macro #12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYZGlmX6HXY&t=8s)
- Before WW2, you had different systems that didn't trade.
- US created free trade, so colonies were able to become specialized
- We went off the farm into cities, which increased industrialization and dropped birth rates
- This decade we will have investment drop, production drop, consumption bust
- we are not going back to normal
- china won't exist by 2030
- CN and ukraine are biggest losers in this momvement
- CN population peaked 2002, they have overcounted their population by 100m people
- for thriving stock sector, you need a lot of capital and highly educated young people
- US produces 55% semiconductors by value
- 10+ semiconductors from CN
- CN subsidizes manufacturing because it's more about the labour participation than the profit
- CN navy can only sail 1000 miles (vietnam)
- To beat CN, it is easy to cut their energy supply by blocking naval routes, they will be in famine in 12 months
- we're at the edge of the globalized era
- 30% chance CN will invade tW
- If russian sanctions were placed on China, it would destroy CN in months
- if foreign companies leave CN, CN is screwed
- XI has intimidated all his intelligence. Thats why the covid lockdowns are so bad. He has noone to talk to except 12 people, 6 of which he trusts
- Putin lied to Xi about the invasion
- CN subs are not missile capable
- RU subs are monitored.
- China have to go through strait which is visually and with boeys monitors
- Russia brought Wagner group, syrian and chechan militaries to go block to block and kill everone.
- Russia is trying to block the gaps, they want to get past Ukraine
- Fight between US and RU forces is destined to happen. RU has to retreat or escalate to nukes.
- RU sees this as existential crisis
- FUel will be concern in war. Choppers require fuel, supply chains needed
- We're moving to a grey area as we are giving more and more support. At some point RU will call BS and say NATO is helping RU
- RU is getting > 1 billion USD per day in sales to EU
- In times of war the state tends to weaken because they have to throw a wider net for support
- at least half the world will be food insecure
- US can grow through all of these problems, and even there states will get additional power
- EU has to become neocolonial if they want to survive and keep the lights on.
- Pie is going to get smaller due to population collapse
- northern and western european democracy can go out and get what they need, but southern and central eu is screwed
- food, finance, raw material energy is what you need. Democracy is getting stronger as labour gets higher wages
- Cut internet cables, disabled cell towers.
- RU has kill switches on all 4 internet cables entering RU
- CN has food insecurity issue due to not getting african swine flu from herd, energy issue due to Russia
- most of the worlds smallest stock markets will go away
- stocks require stable sysem with a lot of liquidity, wont exist
- bonds will be the way governments and big companies raise funding. Since need for money will be massive, there will be high supply and not many capital providers, so it's a buyers market
- Be prepared for at least the mid 70's and the immediate aftermath of the oil crisis. It will probably never be that good
- metal-backed currencies have been so successfull it always leads to wars. Fiat is about trust, not many countries with trust each other. USD remains king
- EU has shown it was willing to manipulate value euro, countries don't trust that
- EU doesnt have consumers. If there is any hope that europe wont fall back to 1945, the euro needs to stay alive. Recent unitedness was promising, but he thinks EU will disintegrate back into nation states with national currency.
- digital currency is moving to being controlled by sovereign
- crypto can only work if it has interfaces with the real economy and is liquid in its exchange
- crypto cant be a currency because noone is in control of the money supply
- bitcoin is the worst example
- crypto is not a store of value nor medium of exchange
- gold has all the negatives of crypto (like limited supply), but with 1 exception: it exists and will always have a base value due to having industrial uses
- bitcoin has negative value because of low carbon movement
- global warming isn't a big issue, as long as we have enough water. Plants can withstand 10 degree celcius increase if they get enough water.
- zeihan invests in long term trends
- things that are in very large markets with deep pools of liquidity (US)
- products that are energy intensive in production
- products that have demand that is demographically driven
- product that needs to be exported due to arb US navy
- Supply chains globally break down, but US supply chains get stronger, so you want to abuse US supply chains
- also bullish on things that we need to produce things that are no longer coming from RU; bauxite, aluminum, titanium, steel, pig iron, wheat, nitrogen-based fertilizers, fosfate based fertilizers. US firm not exposed to soviet union
- you cant invest in global funds, you have to go more specific.
- period of bottomless supplies of capital are ending
- we're gonna have fewer financial professionals
- high frequency trading, ETFs, broad index funds dont work in this environment
- cost of capital will rise. 
- You have to do your homework, you can't rely on CFA anymore
- US and Mexico will be able to tinker with existing system for 30 years. EU and asia will change significantly in terms of economic and political models in the next 30 years
- energy crisis, food crisis, financial crisis
- food is his number 1 concern. 
- agriculture cant be specialized anymore, bringing wheat back to the core of the production system. No issue for US, but for the rest it will
- we're already deep in breakdown fertilizer
- simply mapping production of each country to each country's needs is going to reduce calories the world grows by more than half!
- in the best case scenario, no wars, we already have
- US, france, austrialia, argentina (if they can get their head out of their ass) will be okay agri wise
